\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}
In this work, we tried to replicate the work in~\cite{Brunet2014a} as strictly and identically as possible. In this process, \noindent\textbf{first} we have replicated their steps to build the classifier they used. After building the classifier, we observed that the accuracy they reported exactly matches with the accuracy we obtained. Then in the \noindent\textbf{second} phase, we tried to replicate the empirical study conducted with the classified document. After replicating the study we verified all the results they mentioned in their paper. After doing this study we have come to the conclusion that this study is highly replicable.
